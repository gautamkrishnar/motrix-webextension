# Motrix WebExtension

This WebExtension allows you to automatically download all the files via [Motrix Download Manager](https://motrix.app/) instead of your browser's native download manager.

You must download and install the Motrix download manager first to use this extension: [Releases](https://github.com/agalwood/Motrix/releases/latest)
